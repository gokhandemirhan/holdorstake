# Should I stake or should I hold?
This project checks to see if it would be better for you if you had hodled your ETH.

# How it works
* Checks your transactions history and sums all the ETH you spend on exchanging (ex: exchanging ETH for USDC) and its todays USD value
* Sums all your staked coins' USD values
* Compares these two values to see if you would be better of by hodling or staking.

# To do
* Support other wallets
